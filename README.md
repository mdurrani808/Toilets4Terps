# Toilets4Terps

Allows users to find nearby gender neutral bathrooms using the UMD Map API. AWS integration coming soon!

## To-Do
1. Improve UI visuals
2. Refactor most of it (see To-Dos). Ideal MVP: sorted list of bathrooms nearest to the person with a button that will open up directions to it in google maps
3. Manually input Lat / long for the locations that dont parse well
