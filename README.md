# UMD Bathrooms

Mostly tested using edge simulator. Needs UI and geolocator API improvements.

## To-Do
1. Make an actual UI
2. Refactor most of it (see To-Dos). Ideal MVP: sorted list of bathrooms nearest to the person with a button that will open up directions to it in google maps
3. Manually input Lat / long for the locations that dont parse well
4. make it fire 
5. block chain web 3 integration
